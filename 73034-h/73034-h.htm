<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>Stonehenge, Shaw, and others have at various times written
exhaustive treatises on the dog, its care in health and sickness;
and while there is no question but that they are invaluable to the
owners of large kennels, I consider that they are too complex for
the novice who owns but one or two dogs. They use very largely
technical terms not thoroughly understood by the layman, while
certain treatments prescribed are quite impracticable except where
one has a kennel-man. Besides, I think not one of the above-named
writers has ever told the <i>novice</i> what to avoid in selecting
a puppy or a grown dog, or what good points to insist upon. Recognizing
all these facts, and recalling how I strove twenty years
ago to find some work that would aid me in my search for knowledge
of the dog, I have concluded to write a short treatise concerning
its origin, uses, and all things pertaining to it, that will aid
the reader in learning its good points, and bad ones too, the proper
scale of “points” that go to make up the perfect specimen, the
treatment in health and sickness, and such other data as may be
of value to him. Experience as a successful breeder and owner,
and having won many prizes largely through “condition,” confirms
me in the belief that I may perhaps be able to help a fancier in
purchasing the proper kind of dog, or, if he already has one, to
aid him in keeping it in health, to know its value, and how to
properly show it (if he is so inclined), so that its faults may be hidden
to the greatest degree, while its good points may become more
pronounced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Appearance.</span>—The general appearance of the bulldog
is that of a smooth-coated, thick-set, broad, powerful, and
compact dog. Head massive, large in proportion to its size; face
extremely short; muzzle broad, blunt, and inclined upward. Body
short and well knit; limbs stout and muscular; hind quarters very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
high and strong, but lightly made in comparison with its heavy
fore parts. The dog should convey the impression of determination,
strength, and activity.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus004.jpg" alt=" ">
</figure>

<p><span class="smcap">Head.</span>—Very large, the larger the better; forehead flat, and
skin about the head very loose, hanging in large wrinkles; frontal
bones <i>very</i> prominent, broad, square, and high, causing a deep,
wide groove between the eyes, called the stop, which should be
broad and deep and extend up the middle of the forehead. Eyes
set low in skull, as far from the ears as possible, round, very dark,
almost black, and showing no white when looking forward. Ears
set high, small and thin, “rose-ear” preferred. Face short as possible,
with skin deeply wrinkled; muzzle short, broad, turned
upward, and very deep from corner of eye to corner of mouth.
Nose very large, broad, and black, deeply set back, almost between
the eyes; nostrils large, wide, and black, with well-defined straight
line between them. Flews thick, broad, pendent, and very deep,
hanging over lower jaw at sides (not in front). Teeth should show
when mouth is closed; jaw broad, massive, square, and tusks wide
apart; lower jaw projects in front of upper, and turns up, with six
small front teeth between tusks in an even row. Teeth strong and
large.</p>

loose skin at throat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shoulders.</span>—Deep, broad, slanting, and muscular; chest wide
and deep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Back.</span>—Short and strong, very broad at shoulders, comparatively
narrow at loins, and forming the “roach” or “wheel” back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Body.</span>—Well ribbed, round, deep, with belly well tucked up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tail.</span>—Set on low, jutting out, and then turned downward, free
from fringe or coarse hair, rather short than long, thick at root, but
tapering to a fine point carried downward, and the dog should not
be able to raise it above the back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fore Legs.</span>—Wide apart, very stout, strong, and straight;
pasterns short, straight, and strong; fore feet straight; toes compact
and thick; knuckles prominent and high.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hind Legs.</span>—Large, muscular, longer in proportion than fore
legs; hocks slightly bent; lower part of legs short.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coat.</span>—Fine, short, close, and smooth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stifles.</span>—Round, turned outward. On account of formation
the dog walks with quick, short step, apparently skimming the
ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colors</span> (in order of merit).—If bright and pure of its sort, 1st,
brindles, reds, white, with their varieties, as whole fawns, fallows,

  <p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Boulot.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="smcap">Origin.</span>—Nothing definite can be learned of this breed of
dogs. Many exhibitors claim that it is little else than a diminutive
English bulldog, bred originally in Brussels and later (about
1860) in France, with the exception that it has prick-ears and generally
carries them erect, as that term indicates. Its weight should
not be over 24 pounds, the lighter the better. In France the
breed is fast becoming very popular among the <i>haut ton</i>, and
promises to be well received here. As yet there is neither a scale
of points for judging nor a club to foster the breed, so the reader
will be obliged to consult the picture of Mr. G. N. Phelps’s winning
dog, Monsieur Boulot, in order to form a correct idea as to its
outline, etc. Its exceeding intelligence is greatly in favor of its
becoming a popular breed of pet dogs. The extreme difficulty
attending its breeding and rearing precludes the possibility of it
ever becoming common. At present even ordinary specimens are
held at long prices.</p>

very little stop; skin on head very tightly drawn; muzzle of fair
length, tapering to the nose, which should always be black; mouth
a bit overshot. Eyes of fair size, not prominent, placed rather wide

However, little can be learned definitely of its origin.</p>

is domed, blunt at occiput; jaws very long and wide at nostrils,
hollow and very lean at cheek; brows very prominent, and the
general expression is grand and majestic; skin covering cheeks
and forehead wrinkled to a wonderful degree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eyes and Ears.</span>—Eyes hazel, rather small, deeply sunk, showing
haw, which is deep red. This redness, some claim, is indicative
of cross with mastiff, Gordon setter, or St. Bernard. Ears
long, and will overlap when drawn over front of nose, hang close
to cheek, <i>never</i> inclined to be pricked; leather thin, covered with soft
hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flews.</span>—Very long and pendent, falling below mouth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Head.</span>—Skull resembles that of a coarse, large greyhound, long
and wide between ears; stop very slight. Jaws long; teeth level<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
and strong; nostrils open, but not very wide; cheeks muscular;
bone under eye neither prominent nor hollow. Ears small, thin,
carried a trifle higher than those of the greyhound, but should turn
over at tips; pricked ears very objectionable; they should be thinly
fringed with hair at edges only. Eyes full, and dark hazel, sometimes
blue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neck.</span>—Long enough to allow the dog to stoop to the scent at
a fast pace.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp100" id="illus058" style="max-width: 6.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus058.jpg" alt=" ">
</figure>

<p><span class="smcap">Chest and Shoulders.</span>—Chest deep rather than wide, resembling
that of greyhound; girth of a full-size dog deerhound should
be at least 2 inches greater than its height; shoulders long, oblique,
and muscular.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Back and Back Ribs.</span>—Back should be powerful; a good loin
should measure 25 or 26 inches; back ribs are often rather shallow,
but they should be well sprung; loins arched, drooping to
root of tail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elbows and Stifles.</span>—Elbows well let down to give length to
true arm, and quite straight; stifles wide apart, well bent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symmetry</span> is essential to its position as a companionable dog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quality</span> is also to be regarded as of great importance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Legs and Quarters.</span>—Great bone and muscle are essential;
the bones must be well put together at knees and hocks, which
should be long and well developed; quarters deep, but seldom
wide, with considerable slope to tail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feet.</span>—Well arched and cat-like.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp100" id="illus059" style="max-width: 6.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus059.jpg" alt=" ">
</figure>

<p><span class="smcap">Color and Coat.</span>—The colors are dark blue, fawn, grizzle,
and brindle, the latter with more or less tint of blue; the fawn
should have tips of ears dark; the grizzle generally has a decided
tint of blue; white on breast or toes should not disqualify a dog.
Coat is coarser on back than elsewhere, and many claim it should
be intermediate between silk and wool, and not the coarse hair
often met with. The whole body is clothed with a rough coat,
sometimes amounting to shagginess; that of muzzle is longer in
proportion than elsewhere, but the mustache should not be wiry,
and should stand out in irregular tufts; there should be no approach
to feather on legs, but their inside should be hairy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tail.</span>—Long and gently curved, without any twist, thinly
clothed with hair only.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Origin.</span>—Beyond question the oldest breed of dogs known, as
on the pyramids of Egypt, obelisks, and ancient carved columns
it is found in bold relief, with the same outlines as shown in the
above illustration. In its native state it is quite devoid of courage,
so the bitches are bred to bulldogs, and that product, showing
most greyhound form and bulldog character, is then bred to a
greyhound dog, continuing this same last breeding until in the fifth
generation we produce the dog of the present day, which has indomitable
courage, wonderful speed and endurance, and is possessed
of a desire to kill. The name “greyhound” is a corruption
of “gazehound,” signifying that the dog hunts its quarry by sight
and not by scent. In England and Italy none but the nobility
were formerly allowed to own a greyhound, and the killing of one
was then considered a felony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>—Coursing hares and rabbits, and in addition, in our

is rarely able single-handed to kill the latter, on account of their size
and ferocity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Head.</span>—If possible should be like the English greyhound’s, but
such formation is now rarely met with. In all recent exhibits the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
skull is more or less round, and face, though still pointed, is too
short, with tendency to turn up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neck.</span>—Long and elegant, resembling closely its larger congener.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ears and Eyes.</span>—Ears an exact counterpart of the English
greyhound’s, though always somewhat enlarged in comparison
with body. Eyes much larger proportionately, soft and languishing,
but should never weep; color of iris is usually a dark brown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Legs, Feet, and Fore Quarters.</span>—Same as the greyhound’s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hind Quarters.</span>—As with the last two paragraphs, the only
difference lies in comparative value, the English dog’s points being
estimated from the workmanlike view, while the Italian is regarded
from an artistic standpoint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tail.</span>—Somewhat shorter than the English dog’s, but it <i>must</i>
be gently curved in same tobacco-pipe way, fine in bone, except
at root, as well as free from hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coat.</span>—Short, soft, and silky.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Color.</span>—Largely to be taken into consideration, and is consequently
estimated at a high figure. Fawns are now far in the ascendant,
and to no other color should the <i>full</i> value be accorded. A
small star on breast or white toe takes off a point or two, according
to extent of white, but in <i>all</i> cases toe-nails should be dark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symmetry.</span>—Must be carefully estimated, as a want of elegance
in detail or of combination in due proportion alike lowers the value
of these points separately to a very low ebb. It is a high-stepping
little aristocrat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Size.</span>—Bitch for modern successful exhibition should be little
over 5 pounds, <i>nor should the dog exceed 7 or 7½ pounds</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Appearance.</span>—Always excepting coat, it much resembles
the bloodhound; it should be perfect in symmetry, strongly
built, hard and enduring, with unfailing powers of scent and a
natural antipathy to the game it is bred to pursue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Head.</span>—Large, broader in proportion than the bloodhound’s;
forehead high; muzzle a fair length, and nostrils wide. Ears long,
thin, and pendulous, fringed with hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neck.</span>—Not naturally long, and looks shorter than it really is
from the abundance of hair on it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>—Hunting wolves, and frequently deer.</p>

<p>Description from Mr. Rawdon B. Lee’s “Modern Dogs” (Sporting).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Appearance.</span>—Not so heavy or massive as the Great
Dane, but more so than the deerhound, which in general type it
should otherwise resemble. Of great size and commanding appearance;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
very muscular; strongly, though gracefully, built; movements
easy and active; head and neck carried high; tail carried
with upward sweep, with a slight curve toward the extremity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Head.</span>—Long; frontal bones of forehead very slightly raised,
and very little indentation between eyes; skull not too broad;
muzzle long and moderately pointed. Ears small and greyhound-like
in carriage.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus090.jpg" alt=" ">
</figure>

<p><span class="smcap">Neck.</span>—Rather long, very strong and muscular, well arched,
without dewlap or loose skin about throat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chest.</span>—Very deep; breast wide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Back.</span>—Rather long than short; loins arched.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tail.</span>—Long, slightly curved, moderate thickness, well covered
with hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belly.</span>—Well drawn up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fore Quarters.</span>—Shoulders muscular, giving breadth of chest,
set sloping; elbows well under, neither turned inward nor outward;
forearm muscular; the whole leg strong and quite straight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hind Quarters.</span>—Muscular thighs, and second thigh long and
strong, as in greyhound; hocks well let down, turned neither in nor
out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feet.</span>—Moderately large and round, neither turned inward nor
outward; toes well arched and closed; nails very strong, and curved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hair.</span>—Rough and hard on body, legs, and head; especially
wiry and long over eyes and under jaw.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Color and Markings.</span>—The colors are gray, brindle, red, black,
pure white, fawn, or any color that appears in the deerhound.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Height and Weight.</span>—Minimum height and weight of dogs is
31 inches and 120 pounds; of bitches, 28 inches and 90 pounds.
Anything below this should be debarred from competition. Great
size is the desideratum to be aimed at.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Defects.</span>—Too light or heavy a head; too highly arched frontal bone;
large ears, and hanging flat to face; short neck; full dewlap; too
narrow or too broad a chest; sunken, or hollow, or quite straight
back; bent fore legs, overbent fetlocks, twisted feet, spreading toes;
too curly a tail; weak hind quarters and a general want of muscle;
too short in body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description.</span>—A smart-looking sort of terrier of some kind,

points, nor is there any club organized to foster the breed. It is
entirely devoid of hair, except sometimes a tuft or crest on its
head and a few straggling hairs on various parts of the body.
It is a lively little fellow, mostly of a brown color, and, though
devoid of hair, can stand the cold very well. It has a rounded
body, a bit cobby in appearance, with somewhat of a terrier head.
Weight is about 15 pounds.</p>

<p>Brains, nose, and speed make the pointer. The countenance

<p><span class="smcap">Head.</span>—Large, flat; stop well defined, and with a depression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
running from stop to occiput. The head should not be heavy, as
this indicates coarseness and an unreliable disposition. A full
development of occipital bone is indispensable. Nose large, long,
broad (black in all except lemons and whites, when it should be
deep flesh color), deep enough to make it “square”-muzzled;
nostrils large and open. Ears moderately long, filbert-shaped,
and lying flat; set low; leather thin and flexible; coverings silky.
Eyes medium size, not set wide apart, and of the various shades of
brown, varying with color of coat. Lips full; not thick nor pendulous.</p>

throatiness; <i>no</i> dewlap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chest.</span>—Deep, with narrow sternum, sloping backward to a
well-tucked-up abdomen; ribs moderately sprung, <i>not flat</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hind Quarters.</span>—Loins should be broad and slightly arched;
hips thick, strong, and muscular; stifles are generally straight, but
should be well bent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Legs.</span>—Good legs are most essential; front legs should be
straight and strong, hind legs well crooked, and both should be
covered with strong, compact muscles, well developed; the elbow-
and hock-joints should be hinged long and set straight with sides
of body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Origin.</span>—This is a point of great uncertainty, as the monks of
St. Bernard are utterly unable to throw any light on the subject.
According to tradition, however, the race sprang from a cross of
a bitch of Denmark of the bulldog species, and the mastiff (shepherd-dog)
of the Pyrenees. The size comes from the Denmark
dog, and the sense of smell from the mastiff. The St. Bernard was
first imported into England in 1815.</p>

coated all over; moves bear-like.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus169.jpg" alt=" ">
</figure>

<p><span class="smcap">Head.</span>—Skull capacious, rather square; parts over eyes well
arched; the whole well covered with hair. Jaw fairly long and
square. Stop slightly defined. Eyes in dark blue should be dark
brown; in lighter colors they will follow them, and where white
predominates a wall eye is typical. Nose black and fairly large.
Teeth strong, firm, and even. Ears medium, heavy, and carried
close.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neck and Shoulders.</span>—Neck long, arched, graceful, well
coated; shoulders sloping, so that the dog is lower here than at
hind quarters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fore Legs.</span>—Straight, plenty of bone, not “leggy,” well coated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feet.</span>—Round, large, toes arched, pads hard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tail.</span>—All other points being equal, the tailless specimen wins
over the one with a tail; the less he has of it, the better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Body.</span>—Rather short, very compact; ribs well sprung; brisket
deep; loins very stout, arched; hind quarters bulky.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coat.</span>—Profuse, fairly hard and strong; double-coated, as in the
rough collie.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp100" id="illus170" style="max-width: 6.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus170.jpg" alt=" ">
</figure>

<p><span class="smcap">Color.</span>—Dark, light, or pigeon blue, and steel gray, generally
mixed with white; white collars, legs, chest, and face greatly
desired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Height.</span>—Twenty inches and upward.</p>

<p>Stonehenge says: “Usually these ‘bobs’ are strongly made and
symmetrical dogs, but without any definite type; they have frequently
a tendency to the brindle in color.” In awarding prizes,
the premier honors seem generally to go to the homeliest specimens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Appearance and Size.</span>—A long, low, heavy-looking
dog, of a very thoughtful expression, betokening great intelligence;
should have the appearance of great power, but not clumsiness.
Weight of dogs, 55 to 65 pounds; bitches, 35 to 50 pounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Head.</span>—Large, massive, round above eyes, flat on top, a furrow
running up from between the eyes; a marked stop, and large occipital
protuberance. Jaw long, broad, and deep; lips of upper
jaw overhung. Muzzle not square, but powerful-looking. Nostrils
large, open, and flesh-colored, sometimes cherry-colored. Eyes
large, soft, deep set, showing haw; hazel in color, not too pale.
Ears long, broad at the top, turned over on front edge, vine-shaped,
close to head, set on low; feathered only on front edge, and but
slightly. Hair short, silky, without slightest approach to wave or
curl.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus174.jpg" alt=" ">
</figure>

<p><span class="smcap">Neck and Shoulders.</span>—Neck long, thick, powerful, free from
dewlap, with a large ruff; shoulders immensely strong, muscular,
giving a heavy appearance in front.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Body and Quarters.</span>—Body very long and low, well ribbed
up, and long in the coupling; chest of great depth and volume;
loins powerful, and not too much arched; back long, broad, and
straight, free from droop or bow. Length an important characteristic;
the nearer the dog is in length to being two and a half
times its height at shoulder, the better. Quarters shapely and
very muscular, neither drooping nor stilty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Legs and Feet.</span>—Fore legs short, straight, immensely heavy in
bone, well in at elbow. Hind legs heavy in bone, but not as heavy
as fore legs; no feather below hocks, but thick hair on back of leg
just above foot. Feet large, compact, and plentifully filled with
hair between toes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coat and Feather.</span>—Coat silky and straight, not too long,
extremely dense; feather long and abundant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Color and Markings.</span>—Color lemon and white, and orange
and white; the fewer markings, the better. Perfection is solid
lemon or orange ears, evenly marked head, muzzle and leg ticked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stern.</span>—Set on level, and carried low.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Appearance, Symmetry, Etc.</span>—A well-built, graceful,
and active dog, showing strength without heaviness. Any of
the spaniel colors is allowable. (See Field-spaniel.) Weight not
over 28 nor less than 18 pounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Head.</span>—Fair length; muzzle cut off square, tapering gradually
from the eye, not snipy; skull rising in a graceful curve from stop,
and with same outline at occiput, the curve line being flatter, but
still curving at middle of skull. Head should be narrowest at the
eyes, and broadest at set-on of ears, and, viewed from the front,
outline between ears should be a nearly perfect segment of a circle.
Stop is marked, and a groove runs up the skull, gradually becoming
less apparent, till lost about half-way to occiput. This prevents
the domed King Charles skull, and produces a light, graceful,
well-balanced head. Jaws level. Teeth strong, regular. Eyes
round and moderately full, corresponding in color with coat.
Ears lobular, set on low; leather fine, and not extending beyond
nose; well clothed with long, silky hair, which <i>must</i> be straight
or wavy—no positive curls or ringlets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neck and Shoulders.</span>—Neck sufficiently long to allow the
nose to reach the ground easily; muscular, and running into well-shaped,
sloping shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Body.</span>—Ribs well sprung; chest of fair width and depth; body
well ribbed back, short in the coupling; flank free from any tucked-up
appearance; loins strong; length from tip of nose to root of
tail about twice the height at shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Legs and Feet.</span>—Fore legs short, strong in bone and muscle,
straight, neither bent in nor out at elbows; pasterns straight, short,
and strong; elbows well let down. Hind legs strong; well-bent
stifles; hocks straight, and near the ground. Feet of good size,
round, turning neither in nor out; toes not too spreading; soles
furnished with hard, horny pads, with plenty of hair between the
toes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coat.</span>—Abundant, soft, and silky, straight or wavy, without
curl; chest, legs, and tail well feathered; no topknot nor curly
hair on top of head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tail.</span>—Usually docked; carried nearly level with back. At
work it is carried lower, with a quick, nervous action which is
characteristic of the breed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Appearance.</span>—Considerably larger, heavier, stronger
in build than the cocker. Conformation should be long and low,
more so than the cocker. Colors most preferred are solid black
or liver; but liver and white, black and white, black and tan,
orange, and orange and white are all legitimate spaniel colors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Head.</span>—Long, and not too wide, carried gracefully; skull<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
showing clearly cut brows, but without a very pronounced stop;
occiput distinct, and rising considerably above set-on of ears.
Muzzle long, with well-developed nose, not too thick immediately
in front of eye, and maintaining nearly same breadth to the point;
sufficient flew to give a certain squareness to muzzle and avoid
snipiness. Teeth sound and regular. Eyes intelligent and dark,
not showing haw, nor so large as to be prominent or goggle-eyed.
Ears long, and hung low on skull, lobe-shaped, and covered with
straight or slightly wavy silky feather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shoulders and Arms.</span>—Shoulder-blades should lie obliquely,
with sufficient looseness of attachment to give freedom to forearms,
which should be well let down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Legs and Feet.</span>—Fore legs straight, very strong and short.
Hind legs well bent at stifle-joint, with plenty of muscular power.
Feet of good size, with thick, well-developed pads; not flat nor
spreading.</p>

slightly arching loins, well coupled to the quarters, which may
droop slightly toward stern.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coat and Feather.</span>—Coat as straight and flat as possible,

Blenheim from the family seat of the Duke of Marlborough. The

absolutely projecting over eyes, so as nearly to meet upturned

<p><span class="smcap">Eyes.</span>—Set wide apart, with eyelids square to line of face, not
oblique or fox-like; large, lustrous, very dark in color, so as to be
generally considered black; their enormous pupils, which are absolutely
of that color, increasing the description.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stop.</span>—Well marked as in bulldog, or even more so, some
good specimens exhibiting a hollow deep enough to bury a small
marble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nose.</span>—Short, well turned up, without any indication of artificial
displacement; color of end black, and both deep and wide, with
open nostrils.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jaw.</span>—Lower jaw wide, leaving plenty of space for tongue and
for attachment of lower lips, which should completely conceal
teeth; also turned up or “finished,” so as to allow of its meeting
end of upper jaw, turned up in a similar way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ears.</span>—Long, so as to approach the ground; in an average-sized
dog they measure 20 inches from tip to tip, and some reach
22 inches; set low on head; heavily feathered. In this respect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
the King Charles is expected to exceed the Blenheim, and his ears
occasionally extend to 24 inches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Size.</span>—The most desirable size is about 10 pounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shape.</span>—In compactness of shape these spaniels almost rival the
pug, being decidedly cobby, with strong, stout legs, broad back,
and wide chest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coat.</span>—Long, silky, soft, and wavy, but not curly. In the
Blenheim there should be a profuse mane, extending well down in
front of chest. Feather well displayed on ears and feet, where it
is so long as to give appearance of their being webbed; also carried
well up the backs of the legs. In the King Charles, feather on ears
is very long and profuse, exceeding that of Blenheim by an inch
or more. The feather on tail (which is about 3½ or 4 inches)
should be silky, and from 5 to 6 inches in length, constituting a
marked flag of a square shape, and not carried above level of back.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus205.jpg" alt=" ">

<p><span class="smcap">Color.</span>—Varies with the breed. The King Charles is a rich,
glossy black and deep tan, <i>without white</i>; tan spots over eyes and
on cheeks, and the usual markings on legs, are also required. The
Blenheim must on no account be whole-colored, but have a ground
of pure, pearly white, with bright, rich chestnut or ruby-red markings
evenly distributed in large patches; ears and cheeks red;
a blaze of white extending from nose up to forehead, and ending
between ears in a crescentic curve; in center of this blaze there
should be a clear spot of red, size of a sixpence. The tricolor, or
Charles the First spaniel, should have the tan of the King Charles,
with markings like Blenheim, in black instead of red, on a pearly
white ground; ears and under the tail should also be lined with
tan. The tricolor has no spot, that beauty being peculiarly the
property of the Blenheim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>The only name by which the tricolor, or black, white, and tan,
in future shall be recognized, is Prince Charles.</p>

<p>That in future the all-red toy spaniel be known by name of
Ruby spaniel; the color of nose to be black. The points of the
Ruby to be same as those of King Charles, differing only in color.</p>

<p>Black-and-tan spaniels with markings of white shall be entered
in Prince Charles class, and red spaniels with white markings must
go into Blenheim class.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Appearance and Style.</span>—The general appearance
is that of a long, low dog with plenty of style, having a rather large
head in proportion to its size, and with a coat that looks like silk
or spun glass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Head.</span>—Skull slightly domed, very narrow between ears, gradually
widening toward eyes, and tapering very slightly to nose;
covered with long, silky hair, perfectly straight, without curl or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
waviness, and extending well beyond nose, plentiful on sides of
head, joined by that from the ears, giving head a very large and
rather heavy appearance. Muzzle very deep and powerful, tapering
very slightly to nose, which should be large and well spread
over the muzzle, always black. Jaws strong; teeth perfectly level.
Eyes rather wide apart, large, round, moderately full, but not
prominent; brown, and expressive of great intelligence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ears.</span>—This is a most important point. They should be as
small as possible, set on high, carried perfectly erect, covered with
long, silky hair, which should hang in a beautiful fringe down side
of head, joining that on jaws. (Well-carried, finely fringed ears
are one of the greatest points of beauty.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neck.</span>—Rather long, very muscular, well set into the shoulders,
covered with same class of hair as the body.</p>

very glossy and silky in texture (not linty), and without any pily
under coat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Color.</span>—Dark blue to light fawn, the various shades of blue—dark
blue for preference, but without any approach to blackness
or sootiness. Color of head, beautiful silvery blue, which gets
darker on ears; the back, various shades of dark blue, inclining to
silver on lower parts of body and legs. Tail is generally the same
shade or a little darker than the back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tail.</span>—Perfectly straight, not too long, carried almost level with
back; nicely fringed or feathered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Legs and Feet.</span>—Legs short and straight, well set under body,
both legs and feet well covered with silky hair. (In a good specimen
the legs are scarcely seen.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Origin.</span>—Mentioned in 1800 by Davidson as springing from
Tarr, reddish and wire-haired (a bitch), and Pepper (shaggy and
light), which shows true terrier blood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>—An essentially vermin-dog, “dead game;” and when a
fox, otter, etc., is to be bolted it is unsurpassed. It is a curious
fact that when unearthing its game it generally does its fighting on
its <i>back</i>, tearing and scratching its opponent’s throat with tooth and
nail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Head.</span>—Strongly made and large, with muscles well developed;
skull broad between ears, growing less toward eyes; forehead well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
domed. Head covered with soft, silky hair, not confined to a
mere topknot. Cheeks have a gradual taper toward muzzle, which
is deep and strong and about 3 inches in length. Muzzle covered
with darker hair than topknot, the top part being generally bare
for about 1 inch from back of nose, where it is about 1 inch
broad. Nose and inside of mouth black or dark-colored. Teeth
strong and very large, level in front, the upper ones overlapping
the under ones. “Swine mouth” is objectionable, but not so
much so as the bulldog mouth. Eyes wide apart, full, large,
round, bright, full of determination, set low and prominent, and of
a rich, dark hazel. Ears large, pendulous, set well back, wide
apart, and low on skull, hanging close to cheek, tapering to a point,
the tapering being mostly on the back part. They are covered
with soft, straight brown hair (sometimes almost black), with a
feather of light hair about 2 inches from tip. The feather does
not show, sometimes, till the dog is 2 years old. Leather rather
thin. Length of ear 3 to 4 inches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neck.</span>—Very muscular and strong, and well set into shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Body.</span>—Long, strong, and flexible; ribs well sprung; chest deep;
back rather low at shoulder; a slight, gradual droop from loins to
root of tail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tail.</span>—Rather short (8 to 10 inches), covered on upper side
with wiry hair, darker than on body; a feather of about 2 inches,
getting shorter as it nears the tip; simitar-like, not curled nor twisted
and when excited carried gaily above the level of the body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Legs and Feet.</span>—Fore legs short, immense muscular development
and bones set wide apart; feet well formed, <i>not</i> flat.
“Bandy legs” objectionable. Hair on fore legs and feet of blue
dog should be tan; on a mustard dog a darker shade than on head,
which is creamy white. Hind legs are rather longer than front
ones, rather wide apart, with feet smaller than front ones, without
feather and dew-claws; claws should be dark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coat.</span>—Very important. Hair should be 2 inches long, and
that from skull to root of tail a mixture of hard and soft hair. The
hard hair should be wiry, the coat being pily, that under body
being softer and lighter in color than on top.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus234.jpg" alt=" ">

<p><span class="smcap">Color.</span>—Pepper or mustard. The pepper ranges from dark
blue black to a light silver gray; the mustards from a red brown
to pale fawn, the head being creamy white, with legs and feet
darker than head. Claws are dark as in other colors. Nearly all
Dandies have some white on chest and white claws.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Size.</span>—Eight to eleven inches at shoulder. Limit weight, 24
pounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Length.</span>—From top of shoulder to root of tail should be twice
the dog’s height.</p>

of worrying a fox when it has taken to earth. It is used by
the operatives in some parts of England for coursing rabbits.</p>

width to eyes. Not much stop, but there should be more dip<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
in profile between forehead and top jaw than in the greyhound.
Cheeks must <i>not</i> be full. Ears V-shaped, small, of moderate thickness,
drooping forward close to cheek, not hanging by side of head.
Jaws strong and muscular, of fair punishing strength. There should
not be much falling away below eyes. This part of head should
be moderately chiseled out, but not like a wedge. Nose tapering
and black. Eyes dark, small, rather deep set, full of fire and intelligence;
nearly circular in shape. Teeth nearly level.</p>

back, clearly cut at withers; chest deep and not broad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Back.</span>—Short, straight, and strong, with no appearance of slackness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loins.</span>—Powerful and very slightly arched. Fore ribs moderately
arched; back ribs deep. The dog should be well ribbed
up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hind Quarters.</span>—Strong, muscular, quite free from droop or
crouch; thighs long and powerful; hocks near the ground.</p>

tail being especially objectionable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Legs.</span>—Straight, showing little or no appearance of ankle in
front; strong in bone, short and straight in pastern. Both fore and
hind legs carried straight forward in traveling; stifles not turning
outward; elbows perpendicular to the body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feet.</span>—Round, compact, not large; soles hard and tough; toes
moderately arched, and turned neither in nor out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coat.</span>—Smooth, flat, hard, dense, and abundant. Belly and
under side of thighs should not be bare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Color.</span>—White should predominate; brindle, red, or liver markings
are <i>objectionable</i>.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus239.jpg" alt=" ">

<p><span class="smcap">Symmetry, Size, and Character.</span>—The dog must present a
generally gay, lively, and active appearance. Bone and strength in
a small compass, but this does not mean that a fox-terrier should
be cloggy or in any way coarse. Speed and endurance must be
looked to as well as power, and the symmetry of the foxhound
taken as a model. The terrier must on no account be leggy, nor
must it be too short in leg. It should stand like a cleverly made
hunter, covering a lot of ground, yet with a short back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weight</span> is not a certain criterion of a terrier’s fitness for its
work; general shape, size, and contour are the main points; it
should not scale over 20 pounds in show condition.</p>

<p>With the exception of the coat, which should be broken, the
origin, uses, and scale of points of this breed are identical with the
smooth-coated variety.</p>

<p>The harder and more wiry the texture of the coat is, the better.
The dog should not look nor feel woolly, and there should be no
silky hair. The coat should not be too long, but it should show a
marked difference from the smooth species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Head.</span>—Long; skull flat, rather narrow between ears, free from
wrinkle; stop hardly visible. Jaws strong, muscular, but not too
full in cheek, and of good punishing length. There should be a
slight falling away below the eye, so as not to have a greyhound
appearance. Hair on face same description as on body: short
(about ¼ inch long), almost smooth and straight; a slight beard
is permissible, and that is characteristic. Teeth strong and level.
Lips not so tight as a bull-terrier’s, but well fitting. Nose black.
Eyes dark hazel, small, not prominent, full of life, fire, and intelligence.
Ears, when uncut, small and V-shaped, of moderate thickness,
set well up, dropping forward close to cheek, free from fringe,
and hair thereon shorter and generally darker in color than the body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neck.</span>—Fair length, gradually widening toward shoulders, free
from throatiness, with a slight sort of frill at each side of neck,
running nearly to corner of ear, which is characteristic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shoulders and Chest.</span>—Shoulders <i>must</i> be fine, long, sloping;
chest deep, muscular, but neither full nor wide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Back and Loins.</span>—Body moderately long; back strong, straight,
with no appearance of slackness; loins broad, powerful, slightly
arched; ribs fairly sprung, rather deep than round.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hind Quarters.</span>—Well under the dog, strong, muscular; thighs
powerful; hocks near the ground; stifles not much bent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stern.</span>—Generally docked, free from fringe or feather; set on
pretty high; carried gaily, but not over back, nor curled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feet and Legs.</span>—Feet strong, tolerably round, moderately
small; toes arched, neither turned out nor in; black toe-nails.
Legs moderately long, well set on, perfectly straight, plenty of bone
and muscle; pasterns short and straight; fore and hind legs moving
straight forward when traveling; stifles not turned outward;
legs free of feather, and covered with hair as on head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coat.</span>—Hard, wiry, not soft nor silky, not so long as to hide
outlines of body; straight, flat, no shagginess, no lock nor curl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Color.</span>—“Whole-colored,” the most preferable being bright red,
wheaten, yellow, and gray; <i>brindle disqualifying</i>. White sometimes
appears on chest and feet; more objectionable on the latter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symmetry.</span>—The dog must present an active, lively, lithe, and
wiry appearance; lots of substance, free of clumsiness, and framed
on the “lines of speed.”</p>

good-tempered, notably so with mankind, it being admitted, however,
that it is perhaps a little too ready to resent interference on
part of other dogs, hence called “daredevils.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TREATMENT_OF_THE_DOG_IN_HEALTH">TREATMENT OF THE DOG IN HEALTH.</h2>

</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">First Principles.</span></h3>

<p>Teach your dog to obey you through kindness if possible, <i>but
teach it</i>. Remember always that it has as much feeling as the
average human being, and wonders can be worked through kindness.
Rather than strike it with a whip, strike <i>at</i> it, the swish of
the whip generally having about as much effect as a well-delivered
“strike.”</p>

<p>The next duty is to teach the dog to be clean about the house.
Should it forget itself, make its nose well acquainted with the “offense,”
rubbing it as hard as you please, “warm its jacket” well,
and then turn it out of doors with a well-delivered slap on the body.
A repetition of the “moral suasion” act is rarely necessary. In the
morning let it out of the house into the yard the first thing you
do, and repeat it the last thing before retiring; it will soon learn
to understand the meaning of all this and cease to cause trouble.
Patience—and sometimes a great deal of it, too—is required to
make the dog “well mannered,” but perseverance will achieve the
desired result. <span class="smcap">Never</span> strike a dog on the head; the body presents
sufficient surface.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Breaking to Chain.</span></h3>

<p>Some dogs take kindly to instruction in this regard, others rebel
against it. Put a collar on the dog several days before you intend
breaking it to chain. Try conscientiously the coaxing process
<i>first</i>; if it fails, then nothing remains but to drag the dog along
till from fear of choking it is forced to follow. Once having
undertaken it, <i>don’t stop till you have accomplished your object</i>. This
treatment should not in stubborn cases last over half an hour, though
sometimes heavy and headstrong dogs may require two hours.
In the majority of cases after half an hour’s teaching the dog will
lead “steady by jerks,” and in a couple of days will become used<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
to the chain. If, however, after a week’s experience it tugs and
pulls on the lead, use a slip-noose collar, which tightens as the
strain grows greater. Choking off its wind when it pulls hard, it
will soon grow weary and act rationally. Should this treatment
still prove inefficient, some people resort to the spike collar, which,
however, should be used only <i>with the greatest judgment</i>. <i>No</i> one
ever treated his dogs more kindly than I, yet, though I never had
a dog upon which it became necessary to use a spike collar, still,
perhaps I <i>would</i> have used one rather than have my shoulder pulled
out of its socket by a dog which I took out for companionship. I
would use it only as a <i>last resort</i>, and then with the utmost caution.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Feeding.</span></h3>

<p>The dog in its wild state is nearly, if not wholly, carnivorous,
but when domesticated becomes omnivorous and therefore thrives
best on a mixed diet of bread, meat, and vegetables. Excepting
when training or hunting your dogs, a purely meat diet is not
desirable any more than it would be for a human being. While
its stomach has the power to digest bones, gristle, etc., through the
excessive secretions of gastric juices, still it is very easily deranged,
and when so affected it may take days for it to resume its normal
state; hence expel the thought that any kind of food is “good
enough for a dog.”</p>

<p>Avoid giving very much corn-meal, as it is too heating and is
not possessed of much strength-giving qualities. Let the diet,
whether it is for a St. Bernard or a fox-terrier, be a mixture of
meat (boiled tripe and mutton are excellent) cooked till it is in
shreds, oatmeal, barley, rice, carrots, bread, potatoes, cabbage, or
any other vegetable added so as to make the whole thick, and
rendered palatable by a goodly supply of salt. Avoid giving chop,
steak, or fowl bones, as they are apt to splinter, and, lodging in
the intestines, very frequently cause death. Give plentifully of
large, soft bones (such as knuckles), which are easily chewed, as
they act as a sort of tooth-brush, and aid digestion greatly. Scraps
of all sorts from the table tend <i>best</i> to preserve the dog’s health.</p>

<p>For toy dogs well-cooked rice, finely chopped boiled tripe, <i>warm</i>
milk, and <i>lean</i> meat scraps from the table, mixed with vegetables,
should form the common diet. As these dogs are very light eaters,
they may be fed three times a day, care being exercised that they
do not overload their stomachs at any time.</p>

<p>Sweets of all kinds are objectionable. Unlike the human stomach,
the dog’s needs much rest; so in the morning feed “just a crumb”
and at night let it eat all it desires. A little flour of sulphur or
powdered magnesia (a quarter-teaspoonful) now and again will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
do no harm. Constant and free access to <i>fresh, clean</i> water <i>must</i>
not be neglected. As soon as the dog has eaten all it desires, take
the uneaten food away, and do not let it remain to be nibbled at
during the day or night.</p>

<p>Boiled liver is an admirable alterative, and one good meal of it
should be fed <i>at least once a week</i>. If you find your dog has no
appetite, don’t try to coax or force it, but cease to offer it any
food whatever for at least twenty-four hours. A fast of forty-eight
hours <i>will do it no harm</i> in such cases, and total abstinence often
wards off sickness. Should it be disposed to eat grass or horse-droppings,
don’t try to prevent it, as both are nature’s mild remedy
for a disordered stomach. In short, feed your dog as you would
a human being, and the result will be satisfactory. The feeding
of meat does not in any way affect the scenting powers of a dog,
nor does it produce worms, distemper, or kindred diseases, as so
often stated. Having used the foregoing diet both at home, with
my favorite dog, and at my kennels, where I have had as many
as ninety at one time, my experience with it for twenty years convinces
me that it cannot be improved upon, whether used for a
single dog or an entire pack.</p>

<p>Puppies from time of weaning up to six months of age should
be fed <i>four</i> times daily, from six to nine months three times, and
after that age feed same as grown dogs; they too thrive best on
diet as already described. Fresh raw minced meat is good, especially
for puppies; it strengthens them and tones the stomach. Give
freely of fresh milk and buttermilk, especially the latter, as it keeps
the stomach sweet.</p>

<p>When puppies are about three weeks old they should be taught
to lap scalded milk (sweetened a little) by gently putting their noses
into it. They will instinctively lick it off, and after a few lessons
will soon lap eagerly. This is always a great relief to a nursing
mother, especially where the pups are vigorous or the litter large.
A little bread or rice added when they are about four weeks old
will do them a vast deal of good. Remember always, if you want
strong, healthy dogs, that as puppies they should be fed nutritious
food.</p>

<p>Bitches in whelp and while nursing pups should be fed on a soft
or mushy diet, such as soups, porridge, etc., as it produces more
and better milk, and often prevents fevers.</p>

<p>If you accompany your dogs to a show, and they are not accustomed
to the usual food given there, it is always best to give
them scraps from a neighboring restaurant, as some dog-biscuits
cause excessive purging. There, too, they frequently become very
nervous, lose their appetites, and often take cold, resulting in
fevers; so it is not a bad scheme during a show to give your setters,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
for instance, one grain powdered quinine twice a day (smaller
or larger dogs in proportion) during the entire show and for some
days after it is over. It has been tried with most beneficial results.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Value of Exercise.</span></h3>

<p>All dogs, whether large or small, should have exercise, and plenty
of it, in order to aid digestion, keep the heart and lungs in good
action, and thereby insure a good appetite. Puppies, as is natural
to them, take plenty of exercise; but it is when they are grown up
that care should be taken that they do not become sluggish and so
pave the way to obesity, which tends to affect the coat, digestion,
and general appearance. The small varieties will generally of
themselves keep “on the go,” but mastiffs, setters, and such other
large dogs are not always disposed to move about much of their
own free will; hence make them the companions of your walks.
It is twofold in its good results: it makes you understand each
other better, and does the dog no end of good. Bitches in whelp
should have plenty of gentle exercise.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Washing and Grooming.</span></h3>

<p>Do not wash your dogs too often, as it removes the natural oil
and consequently the gloss, which is so much desired. Careful
and <i>daily</i> brushing with a dandy-brush, followed by a rubbing
down with mittens made of chamois leather, will keep a dog’s coat
in wonderfully fine condition and <i>for a long while</i>. The hound
gloves are found to be of great value with smooth-coated dogs,
such as Great Danes, pointers, bull-terriers, etc. In the long-haired
classes use a brush with one-and-a-half-inch bristles, and a
comb with teeth very short and wide apart, not unlike a barber’s
comb. When washing, best results are attained with <i>pure</i> Castile
soap, and after rinsing off the dog then using the <i>imported</i> German
green soft soap. The latter seems to restore the gloss, is better
than using eggs, and does not leave the hair so dry. <i>Don’t</i> wash
your dog within two hours after feeding, and when you do it, <i>do it
as quickly as possible</i>, using <i>lukewarm</i> water. Exercise the dog
freely <i>after</i> it has been well dried. Towels made of salt-sacks are
the best for drying purposes.</p>

<p>Great care should be taken in washing Yorkshires and toy
spaniels, as, their coats being soft, they hold the dampness even
after they appear to be thoroughly dry. The best and safest mode
is as follows: Place the dog in a little foot-tub of lukewarm water
deep enough to reach to its elbows, and cover the body with soap-<i>suds</i>,
<i>never</i> putting the soap on the coat. With a soft hair-brush<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
of long bristles brush the hair with the suds, always brushing from
the center <i>downward</i>, thus reaching all parts of the body, <i>including
the head</i>. When the dog is cleaned gently force all the suds and
water out by smoothing the hair as instructed in brushing, then lift
it into another tub of clean lukewarm water and with a soft sponge
rinse well. Stand the dog on a table, envelop the body in a soft
towel or cloth, and gently press the hands over it until the water
and moisture are all absorbed by the cloth. <i>Never</i> ruffle or rub the
hair; simply smooth it.</p>

<p>Now with a comb of short and widely separated teeth comb
out the hair, and with about three brushes, always kept dry by
being laid before the fire, brush the hair till it is perfectly dry.
Then lay the dog before the fire, where it will be <i>very</i> warm, thus
insuring it from catching cold. Such prominent breeders as Senn,
Burkhardt, <i>et al.</i>, dry their dogs in an oven made especially for the
purpose.</p>

<p>After the dog is thoroughly dried, brush it, let it run about the
house for an hour or so, and then let it rest on a <i>linen</i>-covered
cushion, which is far better than velvet or plush, as the coat does
not adhere to it. A very little fine oil in the palm of the hand
rubbed over the coat will generally restore the gloss after washing.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Fleas.</span></h3>

<p>The bane of a dog’s existence is fleas. They are especially
troublesome to puppies, worrying them till they become fretful,
causing them to irritate the skin and tear their coats through
scratching, seeking relief from itching. In addition, where fleas
are particularly numerous on a dog they will often so affect it that
its appetite is impaired and its digestive organs affected by worriment.</p>

<p>Carbolic soaps will kill these pests, also destroy the hair if constantly
used; therefore the greatest permanent relief is found in
using a powder. The best results can be attained by taking the
dog into the yard or street, dusting it thoroughly with P. D. Q.
Compound Powder, rubbing it well into the skin, when both fleas
and nits will cease to exist. It is not injurious either to the dog or
its hair, and if used on furniture or carpets will prove equally
efficacious.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Kenneling.</span></h3>

<p>If you desire to kennel your dog out of doors, <i>remember always</i>
that it can stand almost any amount of cold, <i>provided</i> its kennel is
<i>clean</i> and <i>dry</i> and elevated about six inches above the ground.
The elevation allows a free circulation of air and prevents the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
bottom of the kennel from getting damp and remaining so. The
boards should be tongued and grooved so as to shut out all drafts.
Provided always with clean, dry straw, the dog will thrive. Foul
and damp bedding produces mange, rickets, distemper, rheumatism,
etc. If possible avoid keeping the dog on chain, as it frets
and irritates it and is very apt to sour its disposition.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Preparing a Dog for Exhibition.</span></h3>

<p>To show a dog “for all there is in him,” its coat should be in
perfect condition, free from all dead hair, and in the form as called
for in the standard pertaining to its special breed. The body
should be round, the ribs well covered; and in sporting and large
specimens the muscles should be well developed and hard. Where
two exhibits about equal in points of conformation come together
in the judging ring, the one shown in the best “condition” will
receive the blue ribbon. Grooming in the smaller breeds is generally
“nine points” toward conditioning.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TREATMENT_OF_THE_DOG_IN_SICKNESS">TREATMENT OF THE DOG IN SICKNESS.</h2>

</div>

<p>In sickness the patient should <i>always</i> receive the very kindest
treatment and be spoken to very gently. Rough or harsh handling
is peculiarly hurtful where affections are of a nervous character.</p>

<p>When exhaustion is very great, and the patient absolutely refuses
to eat, soft, nutritious food should be forced down the throat by
first placing it in the mouth, then closing the jaws gently yet
firmly, and softly rubbing the windpipe with the hand, thus causing
the patient to swallow. Strange to relate, almost any sick dog
will eagerly eat meat which has been masticated by its attendant.
Warmth and perfect quiet are great factors of a complete and early
recovery.</p>

<p>When convalescent the patient should have soft, nourishing food
(beef-tea and rice, etc.), and whenever meat is given it should be
hashed or cut as fine as possible.</p>

<p>A little port-wine can <i>always</i> be given in this description of food
with beneficial results. Food should be administered in small
quantities and at short intervals.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Canker of the Ear.</span></h3>

<p>Internal canker is an inflammation of the lining membrane of
the passage to the ear, accompanied sometimes with suppuration,
and when of long standing has a most offensive-smelling discharge.
A mangy affection of the ear is often confounded with, or supposed
to be, an external canker.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The ear is very red, inflamed, and heated. The
dog continually scratches it, shaking the head as if to remove something
from it. After syringing the ear well with warm water and
Castile soap, use the following remedy twice daily, holding the
dog’s head sidewise on the lap and gently pouring a little into the
ear.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Colds.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Chilliness, shivering, languor, dry, hot nose, accompanied
by a thin discharge from the nose.</p>

<p>If the patient is not attended to <i>at once</i> the complaint may lead
to distemper and fevers.</p>

<p>Use Fever Mixture, and keep patient warm.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Colic and Inflammation of the Bowels.</span></h3>

<p>To discover the difference between colic and inflammation of
the bowels, press the hand along the belly, and if the movement
gives relief, the probable trouble is colic. If pain attends the pressure,
it is probably inflammation. In these two cases, my advice
is to consult a veterinarian <i>at once</i>. The symptoms of both affections
are evidenced by the dog standing with arched back and feet
drawn toward one another, or crouching with belly on the ground.
Inflammation is generally of slower development than colic.</p>

<p>When a dog is affected with colic it is often shown when it is
apparently in the best of health and eating well; it is seized with
spasms, causing it to moan and howl. The causes are about identical
with inflammation of the bowels.</p>

<p>As soon as convinced that colic is the cause of the trouble, give
<i>at once</i>, to a dog of, say, 25 pounds, <i>not</i> quite a teaspoonful of the
following in three tablespoonfuls of milk or gruel: compound
spirits of sulphuric ether (Hoffman’s anodyne) and tincture of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
opium, <i>equal parts</i>. If relief does not immediately ensue, repeat
the dose in half an hour.</p>

<p>After permanent relief, give Purgative Mixture, once a day for
three days. (See Inflammation of the Bowels.)</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Coughs.</span></h3>

<p>Cough is a symptom of disease rather than a disease in itself,
and arises from different causes, differing in character as do the
diseases which it precedes, viz.: in the common cold the cough
is slight and humid; in bronchitis, hard, dry, and frequent; in
inflammation of the lungs and pleurisy, short and suppressed, accompanied
with great pain; in asthma, hard and wheezy, followed
by vomiting; in distemper, husky and hollow.</p>

<p>For the common cold or cough use either Cough Remedy
No. 1 or No. 2. The first is especially good for affections of the
respiratory organs.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cuts, Wounds, Etc.</span></h3>

<p>As soon as the cut stops bleeding, which is accomplished either
by holding the parts together with the fingers or by use of a lint
bandage, wash the wound thoroughly with warm water so as to
remove all foreign substances. Then apply with a soft brush a
dressing of friars’ balsam, which will form a sort of crust over the
wound, keeping out dust, dirt, etc., and allowing the wound to heal
quickly.</p>

<p>The sewing up of a wound is a very easy affair. Pass the needle
through the skin on one side of the wound from the <i>outside</i> inward,
and through the corresponding part on the opposite side from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
<i>inside</i> outward. Draw the lips of the wound together gently, and
tying the silk thread in a strong knot, cut off ends close, so that
the dog cannot bite them. Each stitch must be tied <i>separately</i>,
and should be about half an inch apart. If possible the dog
should be muzzled, not only during the operation, but for several
days afterward. The wound should be constantly washed with the
following:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Distemper.</span></h3>

<p>There are three kinds of distemper, viz., of the head, of the lungs,
and of the bowels. Good nursing is nine points out of ten for conquering
this fell disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Mucous discharge from eyes or nose, or both,
dry, hacking cough, general lassitude, diarrhea of very offensive
odor.</p>

<p><i>Do not try to treat the patient</i>, for, unless you are an M.D. or
have had a long experience with the disease, you will probably
make a sorry mess of it. Until a veterinarian arrives, keep the
patient quiet, warm, out of all draft, feeding only beef-tea with
brandy added. Do not give solid food under any circumstances.
Bear always in mind that this disease is most contagious, and, to
prevent it from spreading, the patient should be quarantined from
all other dogs, the farther off the better.</p>

<p>Dr. T. G. Sherwood, a member of the Royal College of Veterinary
Surgery, 127 West Thirty-seventh Street, New York, inoculated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
four of the author’s dogs, and the result was satisfactory beyond
all expectation, as other dogs not so treated quickly succumbed to
the disease.</p>

<p>As distemper is about equivalent to pneumonia or inflammation
of the lungs in human beings, the reader will readily understand
how useless it would be for a layman to try to treat these diseases.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Inflammation of the Bowels.</span></h3>

<p>The main causes of this affection are irregular, improper, or
stale diet, irritation caused by some hard, indigestible substance
in the stomach, exposure to cold or wet, and a blow, such as a
kick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Feverishness, nose hot and dry, shivering, distended

scientific treatment, call in a veterinarian <i>at once</i>. If, however, you
desire to try to relieve the dog awaiting his advent, proceed at
once to give injections of thin oatmeal gruel or soap and lukewarm
water, each containing about one ounce of castor-oil. Continue
these injections every fifteen minutes till relief is given. The utmost
gentleness must be used in this procedure, the patient being
coaxed to rest on its side while the injections are being administered.</p>

<p>Where inflammation is very great and the feet are swollen, first
apply a poultice of bran and boiled turnips, equal parts.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mange.</span></h3>

<p>Mange as applied to animals is the same as itch in human beings,
being beyond question caused by a parasite burrowing into the
skin, resulting in the falling out of the hair, and sometimes in an
exudation of an offensive-smelling pus, itching to such a degree
that the patient scratches continuously.</p>

<p>There are two varieties of mange, viz., sarcoptic and follicular,
both of which are contagious to animals, though very rarely to
human beings. The first variety shows itself in little red spots,
which exude a sort of pus, and these will spread over the entire
body unless checked. Follicular mange is less irritating than the
sarcoptic, but gives off a very offensive pus. This variety is generally
very stubborn before yielding to treatment.</p>

<p>Provided the affected parts are not raw, rub well into the skin
(twice daily) for three days a lotion of equal parts of benzine and
sweet-oil. This will destroy the parasites. Then for a week apply
daily the following, rubbing it well into the skin:</p>

</div>

<p>Purgative Mixture (Mild) should be given twice a week for at
least three weeks.</p>

<p>A surfeit often shows itself on a dog, which is sometimes called
red mange. This is not due to a parasite, but to overheated blood,
resulting either from improper food, want of exercise, fleas, or inoperative
digestive organs. Treat this affection as prescribed for mange.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Worms.</span></h3>

<p>There are three principal worms infesting dogs.</p>

<p>First, the common roundworm, from two to six inches in length,
of a pale pink color, very thin like vermicelli, and greatly resembling
the common earth- or angleworm. This is the worm most
common in puppies, and inhabits the stomach and lower intestines.</p>

<p>Second, the tænia, or tapeworm, made up of white, flat joints
(about half an inch long), often of great length, and also inhabiting
the small intestines. It is about as thick as very coarse thread.
Both extremities of this worm must be removed, else it will grow
again.</p>

<p>Third, the pin- or threadworm, inhabiting the lower bowels,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
about half an inch in length and of pinkish color. It is apt to
cause partial paralysis in puppies, which disappears after the worms
are expelled.</p>

<p>More puppies and grown dogs die each year from worms than
from <i>all diseases combined</i>. Their presence is generally manifested
by the coat being dry and staring, dull and devoid of gloss, disturbed
sleep very often resulting in fits, appetite capricious, distention
of the stomach, breath generally offensive, nose hot and
dry, loss of flesh, diarrhea accompanied by mucous discharge, and
general irritableness. From an experience of ten years with Glover’s
Vermifuge for <i>all kinds of worms</i>, I have never found anything to
equal it, <i>especially for puppies</i>, however delicate. Having made it
always a point to give my puppies a couple of doses of vermifuge
at two and six months of age, whether they show evidences of
having worms or not, I have rarely had any further trouble with
these pests.</p>

champion dogs, namely, beauty of outline coupled with a fineness

Chinese type, etc. The same applies to a dog.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Undershot.</i> The lower teeth projecting in front of the upper ones.</p>

<span class="smaller">Meat Cakes, Fish Cakes, Hound Meal,
Bulldog Meal.</span></p>

<p>Since the Belfast Dog Show in 1891, when I got the first consignment of your
“EXCELSIOR HOUND MEAL,” I have used no other kind; before that
time my dogs were much troubled with a skin disease brought to my Kennels
by a dog from Newcastle-on-Tyne, but in less than three months they were
completely free from the disease, and it has not since returned.</p>

<p>My dogs all like the “MEAL,” and I find that Puppies fed on it thrive better
than on some of the <i>much puffed</i> Puppy Foods.</p>

<p>A careful “chemical analysis,” made before using it exclusively, proved that
the essential and accessory food constituents were present in proper proportions.</p>

<p>I always recommend it to anyone who consults me on the subject.</p>

<p class="center">Very truly yours,</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>: I have

Biscuits now for about
five years, and find
them perfectly satisfactory

trim. (Signed)</p>
